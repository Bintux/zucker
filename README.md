## sweet ideas about videos to make

+ Person goes into toilet, sound "Dispensing product" plays followed by Doom injury sound

+ Ofspring song "Pretty Fly for a White Guy" - give it to me baby is playing and then actor hands something out with the comment "Ok here"

+ Camera Mapping Video - Actor shoots portal on desk and second portal on ceiling above coworkers and then pours water into the portal and on the coworkers head 

+ Steampunk Laptop - what if Laptops were invented 100 years ago?
  Guy comes into the office with a huge laptop , has to put in coal, and operate huge leavers to start programs

+ Instant drunk
  Guy drinks tons of shots. waits for a bit and then it hits him 

+ Office timelapse
  Put camera in office and film different timelapes - like what happens on the weekend (timelapse?)
